# Human Activity Recognition Project

This project uses machine learning to detect human activity based on sensor data. This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

This project uses the **MHEALTH (Mobile Health) Dataset**.

You can download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

**Note:** The raw data file (`mhealth_raw_data.csv`) is not included in this repository due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit and is listed in the `.gitignore` file.
